# Jasmine NPM 4.0.1 Release Notes

## Summary

This release fixes loading of files with nonstandard extensions (e.g. .jsx,
.coffee) in the default configuration by falling back to `require()` when
`import()` fails because of an unsupported file extension. See
[#188](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm/issues/188).
