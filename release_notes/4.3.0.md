# Jasmine NPM 4.3.0 Release Nodes

This release updates the jasmine-core dependency to 4.3.0. See the

# New features

* Added a config option to disable listing pending specs when there are failures 
  * This can make failure output easier to read when there are also a number of

    the config file or call `.alwaysListPendingSpecs(false)` on the `Jasmine`
    instance.


## Documentation updates

* Copied CODE_OF_CONDUCT from core repo

## Internal improvements

* Converted `Jasmine` and `Loader` to ES6 classes

## Supported environments
